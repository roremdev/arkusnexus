## Code Review

> When someone join to our team. First steps to do is generate trust along of team.

**_Code review_** is a concept simple that explain the way to do each thing better and improve the _developer experience_.

We can understand the code review concept as the purpose to make sure all overall code health improve from base.

Exist several ways to reach better developer experience and the _code review_ is a best way to reach it. For example:

- **The Email / Chat Thread**. As soon as a given piece of code is ready for review, the file is sent around to the appropriate colleagues channel. Could be from a simple email to a message in Slack / Discord or in a open ticket inside of a platform like a Jira or CodeStream.
- **Pair Programming**. When you start in a new job or team development, you could have a colleague that you teach the work ways team develop and which the KPI's or features are important for the head engineers.

My favorite way to do _code review_ is create a work board with a methodology for tracking our progress such as SCRUM or Kanban.

### Kanban

We can brake the board into five componentes:

1. **Visual Signals**. Since Kanban is a visual representation of how the things are done, we can encapsulate one-to-one user/developer stories.
2. **Columns**. In its simplest form, each column represents a specific activity that together compose a “workflow”.
3. **Work In Progress**. Being the limit maximum number of cards that can be in one column at any give time. Because the team needs to bring focus to reach little sprints.
4. **Commitment Point**. Kanban teams often have a backlog for their board. This is where customers and teammates put ideas for projects that the team can pick up when they are ready. The commitment point is the moment when an idea is picked up by the team and work starts on the project.
5. **Delivery Point**. For most teams, the delivery point is when the product or service is in the hands of the customer. The team’s goal is to take cards from the commitment point to the delivery point as fast as possible. The elapsed time between the two is the called Lead Time. Kanban teams are continuously improving to decrease their lead time as much as possible.
